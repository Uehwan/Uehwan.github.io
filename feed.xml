With an unprecedented scale of available data and computational resources, robotics systems could better understand the surrounding environments and improve user experience in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. In various domains, our research aims to design robotics systems that 1) extract both semantic and physical information from sensor data for understanding the surrounding environments (perception), 2) safely reach the goal point in unstructured environments (navigation) and 3) elicit user behavior, intention or message from sensor data for promoting natural HRI experiences. Our research attempts to take a step toward the long-dreamed goal of replacing repetitive and dangerous tasks with robotics systems and natural interaction between human and robotics systems.</p>

<p>Specifically, our research has focused on making robotics systems for three crucial components of <strong>robot-in-the-loop research scenarios</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multi-modal perception and navigation</li>
  <li>service robots</li>
  <li>intelligent interaction design</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all, robotics systems must be able to perceive the semantic entities inherent in the environments as well as the geometry of the environments in order to perform high-level tasks such as errands, cleaning, cooking, and answering questions in addition to navigation. If the systems collect just one type of information among the physical information and semantics of the surrounding environment, they can merely perform simple tasks and cannot provide meaningful services to humans.</p>

<p>Next, versatile manipulation, and recognition of human behavior, intention or message are the very starting point of providing appropriate services to humans. Failing to equip the systems with these capabilities results in irrelevant services—leading to user dissatisfaction. Robootics systems gather information regarding the environment or human through various sensor devices; computationally process the information; detect human behavior, intention, or message; and perform manipulation to realize services.</p>

<p>Further, the natural interaction between humans and robots is becoming more and more important as service robots have started to get deployed in our daily lives. Without natural interaction, robotics systems cannot maximize user satisfaction—missing the very goal of service robots. Natural HRI requires the investigation of human expectation and the reaction of humans, and the process of appropriate designs for intelligent interaction systems in robot-in-the-loop scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>[Research Goal]</strong> Design a computationally-efficient network architecture to recognize both semantic and geometric information of the surrounding environments. <br />
<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> Conventional approaches combine two techniques to associate geometric and semantic information elicited from the surrounding environments. However, running both algorithms simultaneously requires a lot of computation resources and complicates the software structure. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we defined a fully data-driven semantic VO algorithm, SimVODIS, for the first time. We expect SimVODIS would provoke the evolution of data-driven VO towards semantic VO/SLAM. Second, we designed the SimVODIS network which simultaneously performs both geometric and semantic tasks. The network conducts multiple tasks utilizing shared feature maps and runs in one thread. Third, we made the source code of the proposed SimVODIS network and the pretrained network parameters open-source.</p>

<p><strong>[Research Goal]</strong> Design an accurate, applicable, usable and scalable environment model for intelligent agents to store observed and perceived environmental information. <br />
<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> Raw and dense representations representing environments with minimum distortion require massive memory space, take much time for processing and lack any semantic information. Moreover, the coverage of abstractive and descriptive representations is confined to the field of view (FoV) of the cameras and the output is in the form of natural language, which makes it difficult for other AI applications to utilize. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we defined the concept of the 3-D scene graph which represents the environments in an accurate, applicable, usable, and scalable way. Second, we designed the 3-D scene graph construction framework which generates 3-D scene graphs for environments upon receiving a sequence of observations. Third, we provided two application examples of the 3-D scene graph: a) VQA and b) task planning. Fourth, we made the source code of the algorithms open-source.</p>

<p><strong>[Research Goal]</strong> Design a robust scene change detection algorithm given imperfect mathches which are more plausible in the real-world scenarios. <br />
<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> Contemporary approaches for SCD, however, assumes an ideal match of the scene between the current and
the past time steps although observing the same scene with a perfect match hardly occurs in real-world applications. Thus, contemporary approaches would not display the reported performance when deployed to practical systems. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we carefully formulated a change detection task that reflects performance in realworld settings for the first time. Second, we proposed the SimSaC network for robust change detection which leverages both dense correspondence (scene flow) and miscorrespondence (change). Third, we designed a training scheme that enhances the robustness of change detection without requiring additional annotations. Fourth, we collected a new benchmark dataset consisting of imperfect matches for measuring change detection performance in real-world scenarios. Fifth, we made the source code of the algorithms open-source.</p>

<p><strong>[Research Goal]</strong> Design a computational episodic memory that learns human behaviors and reasons human intentions. <br />
<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> Conventional learning and reasoning algorithms such as hidden Markov model (HMM) or reinforcement learning (RL) either learn in an off-line setting or suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Adaptive theory resonance (ART) networks display instability in long-term scenarios and lack a feedback mechanism. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we designed a stabilized memory system with a feedback mechanism for incremental learning of human behaviors and reasoning human intentions. Second, we proposed a home service provision framework for robot and IoT collaboration using the proposed SF-ART architecture. Third, we set up a Smart Home environment and verify the effectiveness of both the proposed memory architecture and the service framework.</p>

<p><strong>[Research Goal]</strong> Design a natural text-entry method for humans to deliver messages through touch screens (users can start typing using ten fingers on any position at any angle on touch screens without worrying about the keyboard position and shape). <br />
<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> Soft keyboards’ lack of tactile feedback increases the rate of typos and soft keyboards hinder mobile devices from presenting enough content because they occupy a relatively large portion on displays. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we defined an advanced typing scenario where both a predefined typing area and a calibration step are omitted. Second, we collected user data in an unconstrained environment and comprehensively analyzed user behaviors in such an environment. Third, we designed a deep learning architecture for a shape, position, and angle-independent decoding and formulated the auxiliary loss for training the architecture.</p>

<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> The limitations of soft keyboards for mobile devices include high rate of typos, lack of tactile feedback, inconsideration of users’ different keyboard mental model, and large screen occupation. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we collected a large-scale, richly annotated IMK dataset which contains approximately 2M pairs of touch points and text. Second, we analyzed the characteristics of user behavior on the new proposed task in-depth. Third, we designed a novel deep neural architecture, Self-Attention Neural Character Decoder (SA-NCD) as a baseline decoder.</p>

<p><strong>[Research Goal]</strong> Design a computational model that interprets the text written in the air with the index finger using an RGB camera. <br />
<strong>[Limitations of Convention]</strong> Conventional WiTA systems hardly achieve satisfactory performance for practical deployment into real-world applications. Moreover, there is no available benchmark dataset suitable for development and evaluation of WiTA systems. <br />
<strong>[Contribution]</strong> First, we explicitly defined the task of WiTA and collect five types of the dataset in two languages (Korean and English) for the development and evaluation of WiTA systems. Second, we designed baseline methods for the WiTA task and proposed spatio-temporal residual network architectures which translate an input video sequence into a sequence of characters written in the air. Third, we  made the data collection tool, the WiTA dataset, the proposed WiTA baseline networks and the pretrained network parameters open-source.</p>

I hope that ACSL master’s/doctoral students will grow into <em>outstanding and independent researchers</em> through the research they conduct with me.</p>

<p>Unlike the bachelor’s program, the graduate program emphasizes <em>the creation of new knowledge</em> rather than the acquisition of existing knowledge.
Therefore, graduate students improve/overcome the limitations of existing technology and participate in the process of technological development through intense research during their degree program.
At first, this process can be very difficult and challenging.
This is because you need to break away from the learning methods you are used to, think critically, and solve new problems creatively.
In addition, unlike midtern or final exams, research can frustrate you despite great efforts because it is impossible to know when research results will come out or whether hard work will lead to expected results.
I also experienced various difficulties when I first started my degree program, and was able to successfully complete my doctoral course with the help of my advisor and several seniors and juniors.
Through systematic advising, I plan to help master’s/doctoral students reduce <em>unnecessary trial and error</em> during the research process and successfully complete their degree program.</p>

<p>Additionally, new graduate students usually experience organizational/group life for the first time after completing their undergraduate courses.
Therefore, lab life may be unfamiliar at first, and collaborating with others may feel awkward.
However, students will gradually develop their research skills as they gain research experience.
Moreover, you will learn that an expert is not simply a person with excellent individual skills, but also a person who achieves 1+1=3 through effective collaboration and communication.
I hope that ACSL master’s/doctoral students will grow into not only <strong>talented people who others want to work with</strong> but also <strong>people who are okay to fail together</strong>.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="principle">Principle</h2>
<p>Below are three principles I try to adhere to during the research advising.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>Autonomy</ins>: I believe that autonomy is a prerequisite for thinking creatively.
Therefore, we want to create an autonomous research environment, from selecting a research topic to commuting time.
However, if too much autonomy is given in conducting research from the beginning, it can be counterproductive.
This is because you may not be familiar with the process of making your own decisions and thinking creatively.
Therefore, in the early stages, detailed advising may be necessary, tailored to each individual’s characteristics and circumstances.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>Responsibility</ins>: Autonomy without responsibility can easily lead to self-indulgence and neglect.
To prevent these side effects, each lab member shares the research goals and research plans he or she has set with other members of the lab.
In addition, you can naturally feel a sense of responsibility by sharing your research progress with other members.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>Compensation</ins>: Compensation gives us motivation to conduct research vigorously and can also become a source of vitality in our lives in difficult situations.
The greatest rewards of graduate school life are receiving the degree and publishing papers, but unfortunately both require a long time and efforts.
I want to help students stay active throughout their degree program by frequently experiencing small successes (rewards).
The rewards mentioned here include not only material rewards but also rewards such as overseas training.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p>Here are two cultures we pursue in our lab to conduct effective research.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>Transparency</ins>: Transparency refers to a state in which all members can check each member’s research progress and contribution.
It takes great courage to share your research progress with other colleagues in real-time.
This is because sharing exposes your weaknesses and flaws in your logic.
However, sharing provides the optimal environment for developing expertise—leading to transparency.
This sharing was also behind the rapid development of the artificial intelligence field in a short period of time.
Further, sharing creates a space for honest communication.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>Communication</ins>: Honest communication creates strong relationships between people and enables in-depth research; integrating multiple perspectives from various people leads to more profound ideas than the research or interpretations thought up by one person.
For effective communication, it is necessary to have an attitude of thinking from the other person’s perspective.
In other words, if you continue the conversation with the assumption that the other person may not know what you know, you can have a more mature conversation.
Also, if you tell your story using concrete evidence/figures instead of emotional vocabulary, you can communicate without hurting each other’s feelings.
For example, rather than “This research idea is really bad,” say “This research idea is a combination of papers A and B, so I think it could be attacked for novelty,”; rather than “The results of this experiment are worthless,” you can have a more mature conversation by saying, “The previous papers have improved the state-of-the-art performance by about 5%, but this result is a 1% improvement, so I think more experiments are needed.”</p>

따라서, 대학원생들은 학위 과정 동안 치열한 연구를 통해 기존 기술이 지닌 한계점을 개선/극복하고 인류 기술 발전 과정에 참여합니다.
처음에는 이 과정이 매우 어렵고 힘들 수 밖에 없습니다.
지금까지 익숙하게 해오던 학습 방식에서 벗어나, 비판적으로 사고하며 창의적으로 문제를 해결해야 하기 때문입니다.
더불어 연구는 교과 시험과는 다르게 언제 연구 성과가 도출될지, 열심히 하면 결과가 나오기는 하는 것인지 알 수 없어 엄청난 노력에도 불구하고 시련을 경험하기도 합니다. 
저 역시 학위 과정을 처음 시작하며 다양한 어려움을 겪었고, 지도 교수님과 여러 선후배들의 도움으로 박사 과정을 무사히 마칠 수 있었습니다.
저는 체계적인 지도를 통해 석사/박사 과정 학생들이 연구 수행 과정에서 <em>불필요한 시행착오를 줄이고</em> 성공적으로 학위 과정을 보낼 수 있도록 도울 예정입니다.</p>

<p>또한, 대학원 신입생들은 대개 학부 과정을 마치고 연구실 생활을 통해 조직/단체 생활을 처음 접합니다.
그렇기 때문에 처음에는 연구실 생활이 낯설고, 다른 사람과 협업하는 일이 어색할 수 있습니다.
하지만, 학생들은 점진적으로 연구 경험을 쌓으면서 연구 수행 능력을 기를 것입니다.
그리고 전문가는 단순히 개인의 실력만 뛰어난 사람이 아니라 효과적인 협업과 소통을 통해 1+1=3을 달성하는 사람이라는 사실을 배울 것입니다.
저는 ACSL 석사/박사 과정 학생들이 연구실 생활을 거치면서 <strong>같이 일하고 싶은 인재</strong> 뿐 아니라 <strong>같이 실패해도 괜찮은 사람</strong>으로 성장하기를 바랍니다.</p>

<h2 id="원칙">원칙</h2>
<p>다음은 연구 지도 과정에서 제가 지키고자 하는 세 가지 원칙입니다.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>자율</ins>: 자율성은 창의적으로 사고할 수 있는 전제 조건이라고 생각합니다.
그렇기 때문에 연구 주제 선정부터 출퇴근 시간까지 자율적인 연구 환경을 조성하고자 합니다.
하지만, 연구 수행에 있어 처음부터 너무 큰 자율성이 주어지는 경우 오히려 역효과가 날 수 있습니다.
스스로 결정하고, 창의적으로 사고하는 과정이 익숙하지 않을 수 있기 때문입니다.
따라서 연구 수행 초기에는 개개인의 특성과 상황에 맞게, 세세한 지도가 필요할 수도 있습니다.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>책임</ins>: 책임이 없는 자율은 자칫 방종과 방치로 이어질 수 있습니다.
이러한 부작용을 막기 위해, 각 연구실 구성원들은 본인이 설정한 연구 목표와 연구 계획을 연구실의 다른 구성원들과 공유합니다.
더불어 본인이 수행한 연구 내용을 다른 구성원들과 공유하면서 자연스럽게 책임감을 느낄 수 있습니다.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>보상</ins>: 보상은 우리에게 왕성하게 연구를 수행할 동기를 부여하기도 하고, 어려운 상황에서 삶의 활력소가 되기도 합니다.
대학원 생활에서 얻을 수 있는 가장 큰 보상은 학위 수여와 논문 출판이지만, 아쉽게도 두 보상은 준비 시간이 오래 걸립니다.
저는 학생들이 작은 성공(보상)을 자주 경험함으로써 학위 기간을 활기차게 보낼 수 있도록 돕고자 합니다.
여기에서 말하는 보상은 물질적 보상뿐 아니라 해외 연수, 공로 표창 등의 보상을 포함합니다.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="문화">문화</h2>
<p>다음은 효과적인 연구 수행을 위해 연구실에서 추구하는 두 가지 문화입니다.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>공유</ins>: 공유는 연구실 내에서 진행하는 연구 프로젝트 내용과 각자의 기여도를 모든 구성원들이 서로 확인할 수 있는 상태를 의미합니다.
이렇게 개인의 연구 진행 상황을 다른 동료들과 실시간으로 공유하는 데에는 큰 용기가 필요합니다.
공유를 통해 자신의 약점과 논리의 허점이 그대로 노출되기 때문입니다.
하지만 공유는 투명성을 이끌어냄으로써 전문성을 기를 수 있는 최적의 환경을 제공합니다.
인공지능 분야가 짧은 기간 동안 급속하게 발전한 배경에도 이러한 공유가 있었습니다.
그리고 공유를 통해 진솔한 소통의 장이 마련됩니다.</p>

<p>♾️ <ins>소통</ins>: 진솔한 소통은 사람 간의 돈독한 관계를 만들어주기도 하고, 연구 환경에서는 깊이 있는 연구를 가능케 합니다.
한 사람이 생각한 연구 아이디어나 해석보다는 여러 사람이 함께 다양한 시각으로 바라본 분석이 훨씬 깊이 있기 때문입니다.
원활한 소통을 위해서는 상대방 입장에서 생각하는 역지사지 자세가 필요합니다.
다시 말하면, 내가 알고 있는 것을 상대는 모를 수도 있다는 전제로 대화를 이어가면 좀 더 성숙하게 대화할 수 있습니다.
또한, 감정적인 어휘 대신 구체적인 근거/수치를 통해 이야기를 풀어가면 서로의 감정을 상하지 않고 대화할 수 있습니다.
예를 들어, “이 연구 아이디어는 되게 별로야”보다는 “이 연구 아이디어는 A논문과 B논문을 결합한 형태라 novelty 공격을 받을 수 있을 것 같아”라고, “이 실험 결과는 가치가 없어”보다는 “이전 논문들은 최고 성능을 5% 정도 향상시켰는데 이 결과는 1% 향상이라 실험이 더 필요할 것 같아”라고 말하면 좀 더 성숙하게 대화할 수 있습니다.</p>
