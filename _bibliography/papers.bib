  abstract={Intelligent agents need to understand the surrounding environment to provide meaningful services to or interact intelligently with humans. The agents should perceive geometric features as well as semantic entities inherent in the environment. Contemporary methods in general provide one type of information regarding the environment at a time, making it difficult to conduct high-level tasks. Moreover, running two types of methods and associating two resultant information requires a lot of computation and complicates the software architecture. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural architecture that simultaneously performs both geometric and semantic tasks in a single thread: simultaneous visual odometry, object detection, and instance segmentation (SimVODIS). SimVODIS is built on top of Mask-RCNN which is trained in a supervised manner. Training the pose and depth branches of SimVODIS requires unlabeled video sequences and the photometric consistency between input image frames generates self-supervision signals. The performance of SimVODIS outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation, depth map prediction, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks while completing all the tasks in a single thread. We expect SimVODIS would enhance the autonomy of intelligent agents and let the agents provide effective services to humans.},

  abstract={Intelligent agents gather information and perceive semantics within the environments before taking on given tasks. The agents store the collected information in the form of environment models that compactly represent the surrounding environments. The agents, however, can only conduct limited tasks without an efficient and effective environment model. Thus, such an environment model takes a crucial role for the autonomy systems of intelligent agents. We claim the following characteristics for a versatile environment model: accuracy, applicability, usability, and scalability. Although a number of researchers have attempted to develop such models that represent environments precisely to a certain degree, they lack broad applicability, intuitive usability, and satisfactory scalability. To tackle these limitations, we propose 3-D scene graph as an environment model and the 3-D scene graph construction framework. The concise and widely used graph structure readily guarantees usability as well as scalability for 3-D scene graph. We demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the 3-D scene graph by exhibiting the deployment of the 3-D scene graph in practical applications. Moreover, we verify the performance of the proposed 3-D scene graph and the framework by conducting a series of comprehensive experiments under various conditions.},

  abstract={In the field of surface mount technology (SMT), early detection of defects in production machines is crucial to prevent yield reduction. In order to detect defects in the production machine without attaching additional costly sensors, attempts have been made to classify defects in solder paste printers using defective solder paste pattern (DSPP) images automatically obtained through solder paste inspection (SPI). However, since the DSPP images are sparse, have various sizes, and are hardly collected, existing CNN-based classifiers tend to fail to generalize and over-fitted to the train set. Besides, existing studies employing only multi-label classifiers are less helpful since when two or more defects are observed in the DSPP image, the location of each defect can not be specified. To solve these problems, we propose a dual-level defect detection PointNet (D 3 PointNet), which extracts point cloud features from DSPP images and then performs the defect detection in two semantic levels: a micro-level and a macro-level. In the micro-level, a type of printer defect per point is identified through segmentation. In the macro-level, all types of printer defects appearing in a DSPP image are identified by multi-label classification. Experimental results show that the proposed D 3 PointNet is robust to the sparsity and size changes of the DSPP image, and its exact match score was 10.2% higher than that of the existing CNN-based state-of-the-art multi-label classification model in the DSPP image dataset.},

However, the phase map includes information other than physiological information. Thus appropriate process for removing irrelevant information in phase map is needed. In this article, a simple band pass filtering based method for the process of phase map is proposed. The basic algorithm is described and then the process of constructing susceptibility weighted image is described. In vivo experiment was performed to verify the proposed method. The proposed method is compared with the conventional method. The result shows that the proposed method successfully removes unwanted information while retaining physiological information.},
