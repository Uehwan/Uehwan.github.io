## Number of Openings
Our laboratory recruits around 3 new members every year through [AI graduate school](https://ai.gist.ac.kr/ai/) and [future automobile manpower training degree course](http://yonseiscd.web4in1.com/). We recruit students for Ph.D./Integrated/Master's programs. However, there are not many openings for the Master's program, and only those who are expected to achieve meaningful research outcomes during the Master's program are recruited. This is to let M.S. students gain meaningful research experience in our laboratory and it is also helpful for their careers.

*For research interns, the number of openings is flexible (see below).<br/>
*For postdoctoral researcher positions, please contact me with your CV.<br/>

## Graduate Programs
If you are thinking of proceeding to graduate school, we recommend that you apply as an intern at least six months before the graduate school admission process. It is important to carefully select a laboratory because graduate programs can take as short as two years and as long as five years or more. Below is a description of each program.

> Ph.D./Integrated Program
  - ###### I only accept students who have prior research experience with me or who have received reliable recommendations.
  - ###### If you do not have research experience with me or have not received a recommendation, please apply for an intern or the Master's program.
  - ###### GIST AI graduate school only accepts applicants with a Master's degree for Ph.D. programs.
  - ###### If you wish to obtain only a Master's degree, you must apply for the Master's program, and the integrated program is only for students who wish to obtain a Ph.D. degree.


> Master's Program
  - ###### In-depth prior research experience is not required for students applying for the Master's program.
  - ###### However, meaningful prior research experience is a powerful advantage.
  - ###### This is the recruitment process: 1) reviewing application documents and 2) interviews with coding tests.
  - ###### [How to apply] Please email me your answers to the questions below and your CV and transcripts.
    - ###### Reasons for entering the Master's program (Korean or English)
    - ###### Your career plan after the Master's program (Korean or English)
    - ###### Reasons for applying to our lab (Korean or English)
    - ###### Research field of interest and related experience (Korean or English)
    - ###### Personal statement and statement of purpose; these include answers to the above four questions (English, 300 words or less)

## Internship
We recruit interns every semester and vacation, and intership is operated on a quarterly basis (January-February/March-June/July-August/September-December). We recommend a minimum of 6 months. In addition, our laboratory expects similar research outcomes for internship, graduation research, and G-SURF (you can combine internship and graduation research). If you are interested in our intern program, apply no later than two weeks before the beginning of each quarter. When applying, include transcripts and description of yourself. For reference, the following intern researchers are recruited with priority.

- Students who want to explore new fields with intellectual curiosity
- Students who grow steadily by setting challenging goals
- Students who consistently achieve goals and finish what they have started
- Students with solid foundations in introductory-level programming skills (GS1401, GS1490)

Below is how we run the internship program.

> Study Intern
  - ###### Through study, study interns learn basic knowledge for conducting research in our laboratory.  
  - ###### A mentor in charge operates the study (study materials, Q&A, etc.).
  - ###### The mentor gives study interns everyweek's study materials / assignments, and checks the progress and takes questions through weekly meetings.
  - ###### The study has three courses: 1) Machine Learning and Deep Learning, 2) Data Structures and Algorithms, and 3) Software Engineering.
  - ###### Of the three courses, you will participate in one or more studies depending on your experience.

  
> Research Intern
  - ###### Research interns engage in a research project.
  - ###### Research interns usually conduct research with one or two graduate students, and have regular research meetings with me.
  - ###### One can apply for research interns only if they have completed the study intern course or have background knowledge equivalent to it.
  - ###### We provide research interns with space, research funds, and relevant devices.
